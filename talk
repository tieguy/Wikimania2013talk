% Open Licensing: Culture, Data, Software
% Luis Villa + Stephen LaPorte
% August 9, 2013 - Wikimania Hong Kong

Why are we here?
----------------

- the state of open licensing: culture, data, software

- impact on (and questions for?) Wikimedians and Wiki projects

Who We Are
----------

- Luis Villa <!-- data, source -->

- Stephen LaPorte <!-- culture -->

Open Data
---------

<!-- Distinguish data from culture (DB rights, protection issues -->

### New Licenses: Open Government

 - typically permissive
 - growing number
 - can have subtle differences

Data Trends
-----------

### Database licensing

<!-- key examples: CC0, ODbL -->

### Increased gov't publication

<!-- positive: lots of interesting new information! -->
<!-- possible negative: increased gov't screwups, learning curve -->

### License proliferation

<!-- Open Definition trying to play same role as OSI -->

Data Questions
--------------

### Incoming data: what licenses?

### Advocacy for "right" gov't licenses?

Open Culture
------------

### New Licenses: CC4

- *good:* readability, i18n, attribution
- *tricky:* database rights
- *expectations:* timeline

### Find the attribution requirement

*CC BY-SA 3.0 Unported, Section 4(b)*

If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a),
keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or
Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,
publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the
name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to
the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to
be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with
Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit
required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum
such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner
at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the
purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your
rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply
any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor
and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,
Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

### Find the attribution requirement

*CC 4.0 SA Draft 3, Section 3*

<pre class='cc-code' style='text-align:left; white-space: pre-wrap;'>
<span style='font-size:0.8em'>
a)  Attribution.

    1.  If You Share the Licensed Material (in unmodified, excerpted or other
    form) or Adapted Material, You must:

        A)  identify the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and others
        designated by the Licensor to receive attribution, in any reasonable
        manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym or trademark if
        designated);

        B)  retain a copyright notice if supplied by the Licensor with the
        Licensed Material;

        C)   retain a notice containing customized disclaimers or limitations of
        liability, or an undertaking of warranties, if supplied by the Licensor
        with the Licensed Material;

        D)   indicate if You have modified the Licensed Material and if so supply
        a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material in unmodified form if
        reasonably practicable; and

        E)  indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,
        and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public
        License.

    For the avoidance of doubt, where the Licensor has Sui Generis Database
    Rights that apply to You, You must comply with the above conditions if You
    Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

    2.  You may satisfy the conditions in (1) above in any reasonable manner
    based on the medium, means and context in which the Licensed Material or
    Adapted Material is Shared. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy
    some or all of the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource
    that includes some or all of the required information.

    3.  If requested by the Licensor, You must, to the extent reasonably
    practicable, remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A-C).

Culture Trends
--------------

### Increased concern about compatibility

<!-- good problem to have: increased remix between open licenses -->

<!-- CC doing positive work in this area -->

### Social networks

- Terms of Service may not allow compliance
- UI may not allow (easy) compliance

### Open Educational Resources

<!-- big new source of content; lots of NC -->

### Minimal enforcement (so far)

<!-- no visible trends -->

Culture Questions
-----------------

- CC 4: timeline, process?

- Enforcement?

- Improved CC licensing on social networks?

<!-- - Commons licensing review? -->

Open Source
-----------

### New Licenses: not so new!

- AGPL
- Mozilla Public License
- Eclipse, copyleft-next (both upcoming)

<!-- none huge, but reflect a trend towards readability, better patent language -->

Source Trends
-------------

### More permissive licenses

<!-- javascript; may be an issue in some places if we are producing GPL javascript -->

<!--
-   Large increase in permissive licenses

    -   Not clear if this is merely perceived or actually real

-   Slow, but stubborn, increase in AGPL

    -   Split motives: some genuine free software, some dual-licensing/"fearware"

-   Increased understanding that GPL is defacto permissive in the web services space

    -   No recommendation here that Mediawiki software move to AGPL or permissive, but potentially something to consider

-->

### Perception of increased enforcement

<!-- not clear there is actual enforcement, but definitely increased concern -->

### Clear that licenses are enforceable

<!-- Challenges in enforcement are not tied to licenses: more about things like copyright ownership, proving infringement, etc. -->

Source Questions
----------------

- GPL javascript?
- Permissive v. AGPL?

So now what?
